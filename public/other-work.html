    <h1>Other Work</h1>
    <p>I have also had experience with part time work during my studies:</p>
    <p><b>Leisure Attendant (2013 - 2017)</b></p>
    <p><u>Edinburgh Leisure, Various Sites</u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gain a personal relationship with the customers to make them enjoy the full 
        leisure experience.</li>
        <li>Cater to the customers’ needs when they were creating a new membership, needing advice, 
        requiring equipment set up etc. </li>
        <li>I drove to maintain a safe and enjoyable environment for the customer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Checkout Assistant (2013 - 2013)</b></p>
    <p><u>Sainsbury’s, 39 Westfield Road, Edinburgh</u></p>
    <p>When I worked at Sainsbury’s I created relationships with customers so that they were greeted 
        in a way that would make them choose the store over the competitors.</p>
        
    <p><b>Team Member (2012 - 2013)</b></p>
    <p><u>McDonalds, Newbridge, Edinburgh</u></p>
    <p>Whilst at McDonald’s, service was fast but was linked with maintaining standards of customer 
      interaction and product production.</p>
