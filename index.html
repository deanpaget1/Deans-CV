        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Since gaining my degree, I have been an engineer for six years. 
            Three years as a hardware/software engineer, two years as a software 
            engineer and a year and a half as a senior software engineer. My 
            current role uses primarily C programming within its projects and 
            requires me to see projects to their release whilst being the only software 
            engineer on the job. Recently I have completed two courses to expand my knowledge 
            of full stack development and have created many personal projects because of this. 
            With this, I would like to be able to transfer my current knowledge of software lifecycle 
            and management and new knowledge to a new role.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><b>BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering (Hons) - 2017</b></p>
        <p><u>Heriot Watt, Edinburgh</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>My forth year dissertation was ‘technical design and integration of commercial 
                technologies’ where I designed, built and coded a wearable device that detected 
                 the user gets dangerously close to live distribution lines. I studied IoT 
                 (internet of things), electrical health and safety, and various technologies to 
                 incorporate into my device. SSEN provided the specification for the device. I alone 
                 completed the C++ Programming of the device.</li>
            <li>In third year, I was a member of the project group who won the BP prize for best working 
                model of a hazardous waste sensor and sorter. My roles were chief public relations 
                organiser and workshop engineer which included jobs such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Design and build the model (including appropriate material and joining 
                    substance choices).</li>
                    <li>Sensor and trapdoor/servo positioning.</li>
                    <li>Marketing the finished model.</li>
                    <li>Helping with other team members jobs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>My second year graded unit report looked into powering twenty homes with an 
            off-grid renewable power source. I gained information on costs, advantages and disadvantages, 
            lifespan and other factors of a run-of-the-river hydro system and a solar system then compared 
            them to find the best method of powering 20 homes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><b>Senior Software Engineer (2017 - Current)</b></p>
        <p><b>Software Engineer</b></p>
        <p><b>Test Equipment Engineer</b></p>
        <p><u>Leonardo UK, 2 Crewe Road North, Edinburgh, EH5 2XS</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>My employment within Leonardo involves me in many different areas of engineering. 
                For my first three years:
                <ul>
                    <li>I worked as part of the test equipment team working along every stage 
                        of the design process for the development of test equipment. </li>
                    <li>I carried out hardware, mechanical and software design using C coding 
                        language alongside the creation of the relevant documentation.</li>
                    <li>Supporting roles where I helped with the production of Radar systems, 
                        assisting with fault finding sub-assemblies, investigating reoccurring faults 
                        and finding ways to fix these, obsolescence management, assisting with investigating 
                        ways of reducing rework time. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I then worked as a Software Engineer within the test equipment group for two years.

                <ul>
                    <li>Coding primarily in C, where I have seen projects through every stage of 
                        the Software project lifecycle. </li>
                    <li>Carry out UI design using Labwindows software.</li>
                    <li>My main project was the automation of Environmental Stress Screening of 
                        Radar systems. Within this project my software controlled an environmental 
                        chamber through various temperatures whilst communicating with a Radar and 
                        running tests constantly. I was in charge of all software documentation and 
                        the creation of all the software and relevant drivers.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>I carry out tasks from my previous roles whilst taking more charge of the projects.</li>
                    <li>I am able to use my experience in all my positions to my advantage through the 
                        software development process. </li>
                    <li>I have worked alongside hardware and firmware engineers and can use my experience 
                        to work with these engineers for better problem solving and creating an advanced 
                        end product.</li>
